  To do interferomery with Sentinel-1 TOPS data by using GMT5SAR
  starting from a given folder having Sentinel-1A/B zip files and dem grd file. 

  Optional parameters:
  -i       if an interpolation is required prior to unwrapping, 0 in default, which means NO interpolation.
  -orbmodel 'resorb' or 'poeorb'
  -tmpbase temporal baseline, 100 days in default
  -list    optional, a list having pair time information

           e.g. 1,1,1 means to process all three swaths...
           Note if you have more than 3 swaths for some areas, we must go back here to update the script...
  -unwrap_0 threshold for individual swaths... in default, unwrapping...
  -unwrap_1 threshold for merged interferograms, in default, 0.15 will be set...
  *

  -et       ending step, in default xxx
            Details of steps applied in the processing:
              step 0: link dem into the local folder
              step 1: link zip into the local folder
              step 2: unzip S1*.zip in the local folder
              ...
  -demonly  flag to create dem only, False in default
  -datadir  path for unzipping and burst cutting... DATA/ is in default.
  -rawdir   path for cutted S1 data, raw/ in default.
  -topodir  path for srtm dem data, topo/ in default.
  -zipcheck optional, 0 for no check, 1 for yes...

  Data orbit data in RESORB model will be collected automatically based on the data temporal coverage.
  In default, three swaths will be processed separately in F1, F2 and F3 three subfolders.

  + an almost new version was ready to handle data cropping 
  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2020/01/01
  + 
  + a list file can be allowed since this version.
  + if a list is given, only specific pairs are processed.
  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2020/01/04

  +ueof should be always set as True for a more robust automation...

  **** NOTICE ******
  A bug was found in the version before 2020/02/13
  previously, manifest(s) were roughly sorted with <list>.sort()
  so for those with S1A and S1B pair, S1A acquisition will also be processed first...
  This is certainly wrong. Since this version(2020/02/13), pS1.s1manifestsort()
  is used to sort manifest(s) by date only...
  
  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2020/02/13
  -roidir a path for output, if give, results will be sent to <roi_dir> in ROI_PAC format...
          None in default.

  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2020/05/28
  #
  since this version, the step control has been applied, which allow to redo specific steps without repeating other steps before
  This could be very useful if the origianl unzipped SLCs are too huge. This will allow users to save some space...

  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2020/07/29

  + Two improvements were made in this version:
    1) dem is not necessary to be given during the processing. The latest version will make dem data automatically based on the SLC data.
    2) re-set ROI to make selected bursts in adjacent swaths to look identical in height.
    3) we can modify iws.in, which can help re-organize the bursts that are required to process.

      -datadir is available since this version, which is temporarily used to store zip and unzipped S1 data.
      -rawdir  is available since this version, which is temporarily used to store cutted S1 data.
      -topodir is available since this version, which is temporarily used to store dem data.

      -zipcheck optional for pre-check on whether the input zip is legal... which could be time consuming...
                0 in default, which means no check is conducted.
  
  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2021/01/19
      -nozip2orb, once this is open, it is not in default to run pSAR_s1zips2orb.py 
  
  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2021/02/23
      -unwrap_alg, a new parameter to specify the unwrapping algorithm applied in the processing.
                   snaphu and fls can be optionally selected for use during unwrapping. snaphu is set in default.
                   Meanwhile, since this version, the data gap of non data in phase.grd will be interpolated using gdal_fillnodata.py
  
  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2021/03/03
      -flength, filter length defined based on azlook in default
      -minnum,  minimum number of interferograms from an individual master date
  
  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2021/07/31
      "inp_copy_dir" can be pre-set in F<x> to store potential processed pairs. If "in_copy_dir" exists and it is NOT empty, the inps inside will be copied out and start running gmtsar processing for those pairs only.
      Note that the folder of "inp_copy_dir" could be generated beforehand of the pSAR_gmtsar_s1.py by running pSAR_gmtsar_inlist2INTFinp.py, which will detect in.list in F<x> folder(s).
  
  Updated by FWP, @SYSU, Guangzhou, 2021/08/24
     -noesd available to switch to non-esd coregistration mode
